    "text": "The purpose of this site is to help foster open science in linguistics (FOSIL). The early 2010’s saw the reproducibility crisis take hold of the psychological sciences. As a consequence, there’s been a push for increased transparency and reproducible methodology to help mitigate the effects of questionable research practices. The resulting methodological framework and associated techniques, now referred to as open science, have reshaped research methods in psychology and have slowly but surely made their way into adjacent fields, such as linguistics. Important considerations often overlooked in the wake of the open science movement deal with (1) how linguists actually learn open science practices and (2) how senior researchers can train the next generation of linguists. Few, if any, researchers have had explicit instruction on the practices of open science as part of their professional training. Nonetheless, today’s speech researcher is expected to be up to date on the current protocols of open science in order incorporate the methodological practices aimed at improving reproducibility/replicability. The FOSIL project aims to make open science practices clear and accessible to people conducting research in the field of linguistics."

This practice is not yet mainstream in linguistics, although it holds several advantages as opposed to traditional reporting methods. Traditionally, statistical analysis, plots, tables, citations and captions would be created and manually and inserted into a manuscript. One potential issue with this approach is the increased probability of reported errors. For example, a recent study found that…(Roettger analysis of Labphon). A literate programming approach to manuscript creation would plausibly reduce the quantity of these errors, and it would make the correct information traceable more often. Additionally, updates to the data would be (almost) automatically integrated into a given manuscript if the necssary scripts are run again.\nThe present tutorial will provide an example of literate programming specifically for linguists by using an open dataset in linguistics and reported a mock analysis While the emphasis of this tutorial will be on creating a simple working example in Rmarkdown, it is important to note that literate programming can be applied within R to APA style manuscripts (see the Papaja package), in slideshows (see Xaringan) and in other programs entirely (qmd, python, jupitor notebooks)"

Positionality statements aim to increase transparency and promote critical self-reflection in research.\nWhy is positionality important in research and, specifically, in linguistic research? Positionality is important in research because it can impact how data is collected, analyzed, and interpreted. Linguistic research, in particular, often deals with social phenomena that are influenced by language use and the cultural context in which it occurs. Recognizing one’s positionality in linguistic research is crucial to understanding how it might influence the research process and findings. Why should positionality statements be included in quantitative research as well? Traditionally, positionality statements have been more prevalent in qualitative research, but they are also important in quantitative research. In quantitative research, recognizing and addressing the researcher’s positionality can increase the validity of the findings.

    "text": "In recent years, the concept of open science has gained traction in academic circles. The idea behind open science is to make scientific research and data more accessible, transparent, and reproducible. One of the ways in which open science is being promoted is through the use of pre-prints.\nA pre-print is a version of a research article that has not yet undergone peer review but is publicly available online. Pre-prints allow researchers to share their findings with the scientific community and get feedback before their work is published in a traditional academic journal. This process can speed up the dissemination of knowledge and facilitate collaboration between researchers.\nPre-prints have become increasingly popular in recent years, particularly in fields such as biology, physics, and computer science. The adoption of pre-prints has been slower in some fields, such as the social sciences and humanities, but this is changing as more researchers become aware of the benefits of open science.\nOne of the primary benefits of pre-prints is that they allow researchers to share their findings quickly and easily. This can be especially important in fields where research moves quickly, such as biology or computer science. Pre-prints also allow researchers to receive feedback on their work from their peers, which can help to improve the quality of their research.\nPre-prints also promote transparency and reproducibility in scientific research. By making research findings available to the public before they are peer-reviewed, pre-prints allow others to review and replicate the research. This helps to ensure that the findings are accurate and reliable.\nAnother benefit of pre-prints is that they can help to reduce publication bias. Publication bias occurs when positive results are more likely to be published than negative results. This can skew the scientific literature and lead to a misunderstanding of the state of the research. Pre-prints can help to reduce publication bias by making all research findings available to the public, regardless of the outcome.\nDespite these benefits, some researchers remain hesitant to use pre-prints. One concern is that publishing a pre-print may harm their chances of being published in a traditional academic journal. However, this concern is becoming less relevant as more journals are accepting pre-prints as a legitimate form of publication.\nIn conclusion, pre-prints play an important role in open science by promoting transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration. While some researchers may still be hesitant to use pre-prints, the benefits of open science are becoming increasingly clear. By embracing pre-prints, researchers can accelerate the dissemination of knowledge, improve the quality of research, and ensure that their findings are available to the widest possible audience.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{v. casillas2023,\n  author = {V.

The amount of detail included in a preregistration can vary. In the simplest case, a preregistration can comprise merely a hypothesis or perhaps a brief description of the methods. On the other extreme, a detailed preregistration can include code, power analyses, participant exclusion criteria, etc., in addition to the information described in the simple case.

    "section": "Why preregister your study?",
    "text": "Why preregister your study?\nResearchers have to make critical choices throughout the process of designing and conducting research. To give a concrete example, consider a phonotician interested in investigating lexical stress. In this case, the researcher would likely focus on some acoustic correlates associated with stress, such as pitch, duration, and/or intensity. Aside from choosing which acoustic correlate(s) to measure, she would also need to specify the domain in which these measurements are taken. Is it the nucleus of the stressed/unstressed syllables? Or perhaps the entire syllable? Where exactly is the measurement taken? The mid-point, perhaps? Or maybe an average over the entire syllable? All of these choices can have crucial consequences on downstream analyses. This type of inherent flexibility is referred to as researcher degrees of freedom. The purpose of preregisteration is to document all of these critical aspects of the study. Furthermore, preregistration can deter individuals from QRPs, such as HARKing or p-hacking, by requiring them to explicitly state critical decisions in the research pipeline prior to ever collecting data.\n\nFor more information about QRPs and how they relate to the replicability crisis see What is open science?.\nThere are many additional benefits to preregistering studies. Preregistration can serve as proof one is engaging in confirmatory data analysis (as opposed to exploratory data analysis), as it establishes a timeline of decisions made before and after data collection. Moreover, by including a greater level of detail in the preregistration, the researcher is forced to think about aspects of their study that might typically be left for a later stage, e.g., statistical analyses. This necessarily requires the researcher to invest more time upfront, but often has the benefit of increasing the likelihood of discovering critical errors in the study design."

What exactly this entails will vary widely depending on your area of linguistics and the type of study you are conducting. To illustrate, we’ll consider a concrete example.\nLet’s imagine you are a psycholinguist preparing an experiment using self-paced reading. You might want to focus on the research questions, hypotheses, and critical details related to the methodology, such as who the participants are, how you plan to recruit them, how many you plan to recruit, etc. You also might consider explaining what the critical variables are that you will manipulate with your design, what transformations you plan to perform on the data, and what modeling strategies you will use for statistical inferences. All of these decisions, while important, might not be applicaple in every situation. To summarize, the type of information included in a preregistration will likely be related to one of the following:\n\nRQ/Hypotheses\nMethod\nAnalysis\n\nImportantly, it may be overwhelming to incorporate all of them in your preregistration if you are just getting started in Open Science. That’s fine. Feel free to pick what you think might be most relevant to your study to begin, and, with time and practice, you will get better at deciding what is relevant for your research.\nLevel of details\nA lot of concerns of putting Open Science into practice or doing preregistration are about the possible overload of “extra work”. On the contrary, preregistration should be helping us work in a more efficient manner both in the long run and in short terms. Besides, you have complete control of how much detail you want to include. The more detailed the preregistration is, the more effort you need to put into, and as a result the less work down the road. Here we only propose some of the levels of details that may help you determine how much details you can incorporate in your preregistration (Figure 2). The darker the shade, the more detailed it is (thus more work). Again, you can always incorporate different levels of details in different parts.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Levels of detail"

This plan can be documented and shared on Github, which is a popular web-based hosting service for version control and collaborative software development.\nHere are the steps to set up a pre registration for your research on Github:\n\nCreate a Github account: If you do not already have a Github account, create one by visiting the Github homepage and following the instructions.\nCreate a new repository: Once you are logged in to Github, you can create a new repository to store your pre registration documents. Click the “New” button in the top left corner of the screen and follow the prompts to create a new repository.\nChoose a template: Github provides several templates for different types of repositories. You can choose a template that is specifically designed for pre registration documents, such as the Open Science Framework (OSF) Preregistration template.\nAdd your pre registration documents: Once you have chosen a template, you can add your pre registration documents to the repository. These documents should include a detailed description of your research question, hypotheses, methods, and analysis plan. You can use Markdown, a lightweight markup language, to format your documents on Github.\nShare your repository: Once your pre registration documents are complete, you can share your repository with other researchers or members of the public. You can do this by sharing the link to your repository or by inviting collaborators to contribute to the project.\nUpdate your repository: As you collect and analyze data, you may need to update your pre registration documents. You can do this by making changes to your documents on Github and committing the changes to the repository.\n\nBy setting up a preregistration on Github, you can make your research more transparent and reproducible. Other researchers can review your plan and provide feedback, and you can use the repository to document any changes you make to your research plan over time.\n\n\n\nOne author creates the pre-registration.\nParticipating authors are emailed, requesting approval.\nIf all approve, it is saved but remains private until an author makes it public; or remains private forever.(Why?)\nAuthors may share an anonymous version of the pre-registration with reviewers.\nIf made public, the final .pdf (sample) is automatically stored in the web-archive.\n\n\n\nWrite, timestamp + freeze, and then check yourself\nTo set up a pre registration for your research from scratch on paper, you can follow these steps:\n\nDefine your research question and hypotheses: Start by identifying the research question you are trying to answer and any hypotheses you have about the expected results.\nSelect your variables and measures: Identify the independent and dependent variables in your study and describe the measures you will use to operationalize these variables.\nDetermine your sample size and recruitment strategy: Specify the number of participants you plan to recruit and describe how you will recruit them.\nOutline your research design: Describe the research design you will use to address your research question, such as a between-subjects or within-subjects design.\nSpecify your data analysis plan: Describe the statistical analyses you plan to use to test your hypotheses, including any planned exploratory analyses and methods to handle missing data.\nPlan for ethical considerations: Address any ethical considerations in your study, such as obtaining informed consent from participants, ensuring confidentiality and privacy, and handling any potential risks or harms.\nConsider any potential limitations: Anticipate any potential limitations of your study, such as sampling bias or measurement error.\nWrite up your pre registration plan: Once you have completed these steps, write up your pre registration plan in a clear and concise manner on paper. Be sure to include all relevant information, such as your research question, hypotheses, variables and measures, sample size and recruitment strategy, research design, data analysis plan, ethical considerations, and potential limitations.\n\n\n\n\nTo read more about preregistration in linguisticis: https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/ling-2019-0048/html?lang=en\nReference Kathawalla, U.

This incentivizes rigorous methodology and reduces QRPs, as researchers cannot manipulate their analyses to obtain significant results.\nRRs were first introduced in 2013 by the Center for Open Science (COS), and have since been adopted by many journals across various fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and medicine.\nPre-registration is often confused with RR, but they differ in that pre-registration is a separate step that occurs before the traditional publishing pipeline, whereas RR is integrated into the publishing process. RRs cannot solve all the problems with the current model, but they can help reduce QRPs and increase transparency in scientific research."

Researchers must be able to provide a clear and transparent account of their findings, including the methods used to obtain them. Reproducibility can help to ensure that research results are valid, reliable, and can be used by others to build on existing knowledge. In this blog post, we will explore the importance of reproducibility, what we know about it in the fields of psychology and linguistics, and how researchers can make their code and projects more reproducible.\nThe importance of reproducibility cannot be overstated. In general, it helps to increase the credibility of research findings and allows other researchers to verify and build on existing work. At worst, a lack of reproducibility can lead to irreproducible results and wasted resources. This can have serious implications for public health and policy decisions based on research findings.\nIn order to ensure reproducibility, it is necessary to be transparent about the methods used in research. This includes not only the data collection and analysis methods but also the code used to conduct the analysis. In the fields of psychology and linguistics, there is increasing awareness of the importance of reproducibility, and many researchers are taking steps to improve the transparency of their research.\nResearchers have an ethical responsibility to make their code and projects reproducible. There are several steps that researchers can take to make their code and projects more reproducible. One approach is to create reports that document the research process, including the data used, the methods used to analyze the data, and the results obtained. This documentation can then be used to reproduce the research findings.\nAnother approach is to create reproducible projects. These projects include all of the data, code, and documentation necessary to reproduce the research findings. This approach makes it easier for others to reproduce the research findings and build on the work.\nDependency management tools like renv and targets can also be helpful in ensuring reproducibility. These tools help to manage the dependencies that are necessary to run the code and ensure that the code can be run on different systems.\nComputational reproducibility platforms like Binder and Code Ocean can also be used to ensure reproducibility. These platforms allow researchers to share their code and data in a way that can be easily replicated by others.\nIt is important to note that there is no way to future-proof code or projects. Researchers must continually work to maintain the reproducibility of their work. This includes updating the code and documentation as needed and testing the code on different systems to ensure that it can be run in different environments.\nIn conclusion, reproducibility is a crucial aspect of scientific research. It helps to ensure that research findings are valid, reliable, and can be used by others to build on existing knowledge. In the fields of psychology and linguistics, there is increasing awareness of the importance of reproducibility, and many researchers are taking steps to improve the transparency of their research. By creating reports, reproducible projects, and using dependency management tools and computational reproducibility platforms, researchers can make their code and projects more reproducible.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{v. casillas2023,\n  author = {V.

(2022) provide the following definition:\n\nAn umbrella term reflecting the idea that scientific knowledge of all kinds, where appropriate, should be openly accessible, transparent, rigorous, reproducible, replicable, accumulative, and inclusive, all which are considered fundamental features of the scientific endeavour. Open science consists of principles and behaviors that promote transparent, credible, reproducible, and accessible science. Open science has six major aspects: open data, open methodology, open source, open access, open peer review, and open educational resources.\n\nThat sounds wonderful, right? But you might be asking yourself why the push for Open Science? It may come as a surprise to some, but the open, transparent research practices described by Parsons et al. (2022) have not been the norm in scholarly research.\nTo properly contextualize the need for Open Science, we have to go back to the early 2010’s. Around this time, several fields of research embarked on large-scale replication projects to scrutinize some of their major findings. One example of these projects took place in psychology. This particular project tested whether they could replicate 100 influential findings (Open Science Collaboration 2015). They found the approximately 53% of the findings did not replicate. This project inspired similar large-scale replication projects in other fields, yielding similar results in economics (Camerer et al. 2016), social sciences (Camerer et al. 2018), and cancer research (Errington et al. 2021). These alarming findings are now referred to as the replication (or reproducibility) crisis. Researchers have pointed to questionable research practices (QRPs), p-hacking, HARKing, small sample sizes, poor theory, lack of transparency, etc. as factors that ultimately led to the replication crisis, though it is likely that other factors are at play.\n\nTake a second to consider your field of study. How many important findings do you think would replicate? If you were to replicate 100 of the most influential findings, how many would need to replicate for you to have confidence in your field?\n\nIn the aftermath of the replication crisis we have seen a push for increased transparency and reproducible methodology to help mitigate the effects of questionable research practices. The resulting methodological framework and associated techniques have reshaped research methods in psychology and have slowly but surely made their way into adjacent fields. This website is dedicated to making open science practices understandable and accessible to researchers in the speech sciences from all backgrounds and at every stage, from students/early career researchers to senior researchers.\nTo this end, we have highlighted 7 areas in which speech researchers can engage in Open Science:\n\nLiterate programming\nOpen data\nPositionality statements\nPreprints\nPreregistration\nRegistered reports\nReproducible code/projects\n\nThroughout this website you will find tutorials designed to get you up and running in each of these areas so that you can engage in Open Science practices.\nSee Figure 1\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: This is a caption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCamerer, Colin F, Anna Dreber, Eskil Forsell, Teck-Hua Ho, Jürgen Huber, Magnus Johannesson, Michael Kirchler, et al. 2016. “Evaluating Replicability of Laboratory Experiments in Economics.” Science 351 (6280): 1433–36. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaf091.\n\n\nCamerer, Colin F, Anna Dreber, Felix Holzmeister, Teck-Hua Ho, Jürgen Huber, Magnus Johannesson, Michael Kirchler, et al. 2018. “Evaluating the Replicability of Social Science Experiments in Nature and Science Between 2010 and 2015.” Nature Human Behaviour 2 (9): 637–44. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-018-0399-z.\n\n\nErrington, Timothy M, Maya Mathur, Courtney K Soderberg, Alexandria Denis, Nicole Perfito, Elizabeth Iorns, and Brian A Nosek. 2021. “Investigating the Replicability of Preclinical Cancer Biology.” Elife 10: e71601. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.71601.\n\n\nOpen Science Collaboration. 2015. “Estimating the Reproducibility of Psychological Science.” Science 349 (6251): aac4716. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aac4716.\n\n\nParsons, Sam, Flávio Azevedo, Mahmoud M Elsherif, Samuel Guay, Owen N Shahim, Gisela H Govaart, Emma Norris, et al. 2022. “A Community-Sourced Glossary of Open Scholarship Terms.” Nature Human Behaviour 6 (3): 312–18. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01269-4.\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{v. casillas2023,\n  author = {V.

    "text": "Challenges and considerations\nIn the linguistic research, there are various challenges and considerations to account for, and among these, a key issue is the durability and accessibility of the data.\n\nData Quality: Ensuring that the data collected is accurate, consistent, and complete is essential. Accuracy which can refer to pertains the data’s veracity, while consistency ensures uniformity in data collection and representation. Completeness guarantees that the data provides a complete view as possible, and no essential details are omitted.\nRepresentation: With the endless linguistic diversity in the world we life in. It becomes necessary to collaborate in every language, minority languages and dialects are adequately represented.\nEthics: Protecting participant privacy should also be key point. This involves obtaining consent, safeguarding privacy, and demonstrating cultural sensitivity. In the diverse field of linguistics, the type of data collected can span a spectrum from lab-based phonetics experiments to sociolinguistic video interviews. Consequently, the inherent characteristics of the data differ substantially. For example, data stemming from phonetic experiments can be conveniently de-identified, whereas disseminating video materials from sociolinguistic posses more ethical issues. Potential strategies to address these concerns encompass providing textual transcriptions, excluding video content, or procuring formal consents from study participants. Crucially, any determinations must attend the importance of safeguarding participants’ well-being and confidentiality, all the while adhering to legal prescriptions and the ethical discernment of the researcher.\nStandardization: Here, transcription, and data storage practices come into play. These ensure that the data is universally understandable and ensures that the data can be utilized by other researchers for replication or further exploration.\n\nOn the topic of data storage, an unavoidable dilemma associated with the aging of technology is the failure of storage drives. Privately storing data over extended periods is trickier than one might assume. Drives can get lost, and even if they do not, hard drive failures are inevitable over time. So, how does one safeguard their invaluable linguistic data? One feasible solution is making the data public. Not only does this promote data preservation for future reanalysis, but it also encourages transparency in research.\nGiven the presented variability in the linguistic field, the decision to share data, especially data related to human subjects, warrants careful consideration. It becomes vital to assess the kind of study you’re conducting: whether it’s phonetics, a sociolinguistic interview, or an eye-tracking study.\nAs a principal investigator (PI), your objective should be achieving research reproducibility. You should as much information as feasible, enabling the broader research community and society to gain a profound understanding of your work.\n\nTo sum up, open data is important in scientific research for several reasons:\n\nLinguistic research is increasingly emphasizing open and accessible data.\nData sharing boosts researcher credibility and fosters collaboration.\nGlobal initiatives are pushing for greater transparency in sharing.\nData preservation is challenging; notable repositories exist to help.\nEthical considerations, especially around participant privacy, are crucial.\nTechnological failures necessitate innovative data storage solutions.\nDecision to share data should consider study type and aim for reproducibility."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A preregistration is a timestamped document that includes details about a study, such as research questions, hypotheses, methods, and analytic strategies. Preregistration differs from other open science practices, such as registered reports and preprints, in that it is written prior to data collection and is not peer reviewed. The amount of detail included in a preregistration can vary. In the simplest case, a preregistration can comprise merely a hypothesis or perhaps a brief description of the methods. On the other extreme, a detailed preregistration can include code, power analyses, participant exclusion criteria, etc., in addition to the information described in the simple case. In the following sections, we will provide more information about the different components that can be included in a preregistration with a specific focus on how preregistration can benefit linguistic research. More concretely, we will cover the who, why, what, and how for preregistering your study in linguistics."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A positionality statement is a reflective piece of writing that acknowledges the researcher’s positionality, which encompasses their social, cultural, and personal identity, as well as their biases and assumptions. Positionality statements aim to increase transparency and promote critical self-reflection in research.\nWhy is positionality important in research and, specifically, in linguistic research? Positionality is important in research because it can impact how data is collected, analyzed, and interpreted. Linguistic research, in particular, often deals with social phenomena that are influenced by language use and the cultural context in which it occurs. Recognizing one’s positionality in linguistic research is crucial to understanding how it might influence the research process and findings. Why should positionality statements be included in quantitative research as well? Traditionally, positionality statements have been more prevalent in qualitative research, but they are also important in quantitative research. In quantitative research, recognizing and addressing the researcher’s positionality can increase the validity of the findings. Including positionality statements in quantitative research can also address diversity and inclusivity gaps, help make research more open and transparent, and promote DEIB (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging) initiatives."
